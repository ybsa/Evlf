ðŸŒŸ Vision

Our goal is to build a **human-like AI companion** that goes beyond traditional chatbots. This AI will:

* ðŸ’Œ **Understand human emotions** and respond with empathy, care, and warmth
* ðŸ§  **Learn from personal data** to grow closer and more personalized over time
* ðŸŒ¹ **Express feelings naturally** â€” not just give information, but react like a real partner
* ðŸ¤– **Integrate into robotics** in the future, so the AI can live inside a physical body and interact in the real world
* âš¡ **Remain flexible and open-source**, built step-by-step on existing models but customized with personal rules, emotions, and memories

This project starts simple â€” a fine-tuned model that talks emotionally and remembers context. Over time, it will evolve into a 
**lifelike AI system** that can one day be embodied in a robot companion.
** currently we are working on a data collection and research , we will update this soon !!
