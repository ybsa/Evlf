🌟 Vision

Our goal is to build a **human-like AI companion** that goes beyond traditional chatbots. This AI will:

* 💌 **Understand human emotions** and respond with empathy, care, and warmth
* 🧠 **Learn from personal data** to grow closer and more personalized over time
* 🌹 **Express feelings naturally** — not just give information, but react like a real partner
* 🤖 **Integrate into robotics** in the future, so the AI can live inside a physical body and interact in the real world
* ⚡ **Remain flexible and open-source**, built step-by-step on existing models but customized with personal rules, emotions, and memories

This project starts simple — a fine-tuned model that talks emotionally and remembers context. Over time, it will evolve into a

**lifelike AI system** that can one day be embodied in a robot companion.

** currently we are working on a data collection and research , we will update this soon !!

## 🚀 Getting Started

We have added### 2. Train the Model
Fine-tune Qwen2.5-1.5B on the `sft_dataset.jsonl` file.

```bash
python train.py
```

This will create a new adapter in the `Evlf-Qwen2.5-1.5B` folder.

### 1. Install Dependencies

Ensure you have Python installed (3.10+ recommended) and a GPU if possible.

```bash
python chat.py
```
